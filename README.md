# SnapApp
This repo will contain the files necessary to make the snap version we have run in different apps, like electron. 

Currently: 
there's two main folders www and eBrain-Snap-master. www contains all the cordova stuff, eBrain-Snap-master is the previous zip file of our robotinacan version of snap that we had which was working.
I left it within the project for at least the intial stages so that it's easier to pull stuff out of and integrate into the www part of the project.
